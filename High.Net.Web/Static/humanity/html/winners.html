                                            <p>
                                                Dr. Rita Smith-Wade-El is a professor of Psychology and African American Studies at Millersville University, 
                                                where she created the African American Studies program. She has worked closely with the Women’s Studies
                                                 Department and also has been instrumental in creating the Latino Studies minor at Millersville.

                                            <p>
                                                Born in Washington, D.C., to a cab driver and a domestic servant, Smith-Wade-El has been overcoming the odds
                                                and confounding expectations for over six decades. Although her mother could neither read nor write, 
                                                she excelled as a student in our nation’s segregated capital in the fifties and sixties. Although her father
                                                only completed the eighth grade, she won Washington’s citywide science fair in her own eighth grade year. She 
                                                would later go on to college at the Ivy-league level, achieving highly at both Columbia and the University of Penn.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Smith-Wade-El’s tenure at Millersville University has been extraordinary, changing the face of the University and
                                               the lives of the many students who have passed through her office. Many of her students say, “Rita changed my life, 
                                               I wouldn’t have graduated without her.”

                                                Away from Millersville University, Smith-Wade-El is well-known for her community involvement. The list of her service
                                               engagements is too long to fully list here, but she does work with the NAACP, the School District of Lancaster, the
                                               Lancaster Council of Churches, the YWCA, Bright Side Baptist Opportunities Center, and the Diocese of Harrisburg.  
                                               She coordinates her church’s involvement in the LCC’s Community Meal, providing food and warmth the less fortunate.
                                               She is Education Chair for the NAACP and has acted as such for the Lancaster Alumnae Chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta
                                               Sorority.

                                                Smith-Wade-El is selfless in her efforts for these and other organizations and has always striven to serve the
                                                 underserved, particularly people of color, the poor and the mentally ill, with whom she works as part of her

                                                Rita Smith-Wade-El’s life and work has always been about putting the needs of others before her own needs. 
                                                She has persisted in the face of disease, loss, and turmoil, and in the face of those who have told her “she 
                                                couldn’t” since she was no older than eight years old.

                                                There seems to be consensus that as a culture, we often can’t identify enough role models. The intent of the Essence
                                                 of Humanity Award is to elevate the stories of the inspirational role models that indeed do exist in our
                                                 communities. The program began in 2001 when business and community leaders in South-Central Pennsylvania 
                                                established the Essence of Humanity Award. The award is presented by participating organizations in collaboration
                                                 with the Essence of Humanity program’s steering committee, which evaluates the nominations. For more information,

                                                Kristen Pfautz Woolley was presented with an Essence of Humanity award in

                                                    children and women who have been victims of child sexual abuse, despite facing 
                                                    the tremendous challenge of such abuse in her own life.

                                            <p>
                                                The three words that most describe Kristen are compassion (she has maintained a 
                                                tremendous level of empathy despite her experience of abuse at a young age),
                                                optimism (she has a great capacity to believe that things can change for the good) 
                                                and courage (child sexual abuse is one of the hardest issues to face in our society 
                                                today, and she does so with great courage and at some personal cost).

                                            <p>
                                                Suffering significant trauma and loss, Kristen has embarked on a courageous process 
                                                of healing, and of using her own pain to make a difference for others.&nbsp; She 
                                                completed her MSW as well as a post-graduate certification in child sexual abuse 
                                                treatment.

                                                “I was determined to do something good with my awful,” says Kristin. She dedicates
                                                 her life’s work to helping others on a path to healing. In November of 2012, 
                                                 she opened her own non-profit, the <a class="link" target="_blank"

                                                 Center</a>, using seed money she inherited from her mother to start the 
                                                 center. Inspired by the compassion and<br />
                                                safety she finally received by a therapist as an adult woman who helped her with 
                                                her healing process, she wanted to create a safe place for women to share their 
                                                abuse, break their silence, and not have to carry the burden alone.

                                            <p>
                                                Throughout her path to healing, Kristen demonstrated the essence of humanity in the following 
                                                ways:
                                            </p>

                                                <strong>Courage and Strength</strong>:&nbsp; As part of her healing process, Kristen
                                               decided to report her own abuse.&nbsp; At age 25, she contacted the State Police, 
                                               Children &amp; Youth and the DA’s office, only to learn that due to the statute of 
                                               limitations, nothing could be done.&nbsp; So she did the next thing she could think 
                                               of&mdash;she faced her perpetrator.&nbsp; This takes phenomenal courage for any 
                                               victim of abuse.&nbsp; Facing down, and calling out, ones’ own abuser, requires 
                                               tremendous courage.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kristen refused to remain silent, meeting with her 
                                               abuser’s spouse to alert her to the danger her children may be in.

                                                <strong>Persistence: </strong>Learning that there is a statute of limitations to 
                                               reporting her own abuse and understanding the dynamics of child sexual abuse and why 
                                               delayed disclosure is common, Kristen has made a commitment to meet with every member
                                               of the PA House Judiciary committee to advocate for House Bill 238 to be passed, 
                                               lifting the statute of limitations fully for victims of child abuse. For many 
                                               victims, as in Kristen’s case, it can take years to reach a point where they are 
                                               able to tell about their abuse.&nbsp; In Kristen’s words: “I want my rights back, 
                                               I want my day in court, I deserve it and every victim does.”

                                            <p>
                                                <strong>Determination</strong>:&nbsp;Kristen is determined to help herself and other women make the 
                                                journey from victim to survivor, and understand that they can move beyond their abuse and thrive in
                                                 their relationships and families.&nbsp; She has invested a tremendous amount of time and resources
                                                 in opening Turning Point to create a space where women can themselves begin to make the journey 
                                                from victim to survivor.

                                                <strong>Encouragement and Inspiration</strong>:&nbsp; Kristen has used her own experience as the 
                                                catalyst that drives her to serve on the Board of the York County Children’s Advocacy Center, where
                                                 children have a safe place to disclose the abuse that has happened to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; She has
                                                 taken her own experience and transformed it into a safe place at Turning Point for women to begin
                                                 their own process of healing.

                                                 to others when they most need it is an indication of how far she has come in making the journey
                                                 from victim to survivor.&nbsp; Survivors are able to reach out and provide support to others who 
                                                are experiencing pain and be a support to them.

                                                The Essence of Humanity Award recognizes individuals who, beyond the requirements of
                                                 their work, demonstrate remarkable human qualities including courage, love,

                                                Christine O’Gorman was presented with an Essence of Humanity award in recognition of 
                                                her work with students every day in the Emotional Support Classroom at Edward Hand
                                                 Middle School.

                                                The students under Christine’s care have a host of disabilities, including emotional 
                                                disturbance, traumatic brain injury, bi-polar disorder, specific learning 
                                                disabilities, ADHD, and other health impairments.&nbsp; She goes above and beyond 
                                                her assigned duties to provide a rigorous and disciplined academic environment, in 
                                                combination with a behaviorally therapeutic classroom.

                                                Christine shares her love of French with the students by teaching a French lesson 
                                                each week, and she works with the students in unified arts, donating her time and 
                                                resources to help them with arts and crafts.&nbsp; She also volunteers her time to 
                                                tutor&nbsp;students after school, to teach them on Saturdays, to provide assistance 
                                                to parents, and she eats lunch with the students each day, always encouraging skills
                                                 to help them become academically and socially successful.

                                                As was so eloquently stated in her nomination, “Christine inspires me, our students,
                                                 their families, and other teachers and professionals each and every day through her
                                                 love, perseverance, kindness, and determination.&nbsp; She embodies the essence of
                                                 humanity every minute of every day, and we are lucky to have such a person in this

                                            <p><strong>About Ty Bair </strong></p>
                                            <p>
                                                Bair is a middle school teacher and co-founder of Exit Lancaster, a noted mentoring 
                                                program for Lancaster City youth. Bair and his wife are the happy parents of two 
                                                young sons, and Bair describes himself as an unrelenting optimist.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                One would never guess that Bair had an incredibly tough environment growing up. He 
                                                was one of thirteen children to a single mother. They were a transient family, 
                                                living on public assistance, moving from residence to residence &ndash; just ahead 
                                                of each eviction notice. Because of this transiency, Bair attended five elementary
                                                 schools, three middle schools, and two high schools. His family had to stay in the
                                                 domestic abuse shelter once and Water Street Mission twice. Bair found stability in
                                                 life in knowing that he was welcome and affirmed at two places in Lancaster &ndash;
                                                 the Boys and Girls Club and the Water Street Mission.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                At those two places, miraculous changes occurred in Bair’s outlook on life. There were
                                                 two very important mentors &ndash; Ted Darcus at the Boys and Girls Club who hired
                                                 him as a camp counselor and instilled a strong work ethic, and Sam Mylin of the
                                                 Mission who led Bair to a new-found Christian faith. In addition, Mylin’s parents
                                                 invited Bair to join their family and have remained involved in his life as parents
                                                 since high school. Bair began to see that his life wasn’t destined to parallel his
                                                 biological parents, and he realized that education was the key to success.

                                                 kitchen to pay his tuition there. Upon graduation, he obtained a partial basketball
                                                 scholarship for college, and ultimately graduated from West Chester University 
                                                with a teaching degree in 1999. He knew all along in his college journey where he
                                                 wanted to teach &ndash; at Edward Hand Middle School in the School District of
                                                 Lancaster. He had graduated from this middle school and clearly remembered the 
                                                needs of the students there. He was hired after graduation and has taught there 
                                                for eleven years.

                                                In 2000, he and fellow teacher Shayne Meadows founded Exit Lancaster, a mentoring 
                                                program that initially began for Hand students. Program activities center around 
                                                five principles: education, community service, arts appreciation, wellness, and 
                                                small business. All thirteen students in the first Exit Lancaster class graduated 
                                                from high school<br />
                                                and went on to higher education.

                                                There have been four graduating classes to date, and each class has had similar 
                                                success due to the program’s offering each student a “winning life plan.” Exit 
                                                Lancaster has expanded to follow each student through high school. In the history 
                                                of the program, any student who has committed to the program has never dropped out
                                                 of school.

                                                Bair also purposefully became involved in other activities at Hand where he could be
                                                 a positive change agent in students’ lives &ndash; such as coaching the boys’ 
                                                basketball team and overseeing the school yearbook.

                                                Bair considers his grounding to be due to his faith &ndash; helping him cope with
                                                 even the tragic murders of two of his brothers due to their involvement in street
                                                 activities. He believes that God doesn’t put anything in front of you that you 
                                                can’t handle. “I don’t want to be  a complainer. I’m a doer.”

The award was presented at its annual gala held at the Lancaster Marriott at Penn Square on October 20.</p>
                                            <p>The Essence of Humanity Award recognizes individuals who, beyond the requirements of their work, demonstrate remarkable human qualities including courage, love, strength, determination, and persistence when dealing with adversity. The award also honors those who demonstrate a spirit of caring and provide inspiration to such individuals on a daily basis.</p>

                                            <p>Angel Feliciano was presented with an Essence of Humanity award in recognition of 20 years of volunteer service to Lancaster’s homeless, including making sure that Christmas giving includes homeless children too &mdash; by coordinating the Toys for Tots and Project Outreach programs.</p>
                                            <p>Working with Project Outreach, Angel coordinates local Lancaster volunteers from  organizations like Lancaster General Hospital, Fulton Bank, the Puerto Rican  Cultural Center, Susquehanna Valley Chef’s Association and churches such as the  First Spanish Assembly of God &mdash; with an objective of providing food, clothing,  and spiritual guidance to the homeless.&nbsp;These volunteers have traveled to areas throughout the Mid-Atlantic (Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Baltimore) and to Louisiana during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Feliciano’s passion and commitment to the good that volunteers can accomplish has been an inspiration to others for more than two  decades.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                Feliciano credits his mother as the source of his own inspiration, and through the ideal<br>
                                                she set, he exhibits a great love for humanity.

                                            <p>
                                                “From drug addicts to the homeless, she opened her doors to anyone in the South Bronx who was down on their luck,” says Feliciano. “I remember all those strangers who came over to eat, especially young women and their children. These days, while working in my church and food banks, I see young mothers and their children &mdash; tired, hungry, lonely and afraid.&nbsp; The greatest reward is to know how many lives have been touched and seeing the<br>
                                                homeless children glow with happiness on Christmas.”

                                                While at Interfaith, Linda demonstrated strong advocacy for social change, and in 
                                                fact thought of herself as a change agent.&nbsp; She was active in the Capital Area 
                                                Coalition for Homelessness and supported efforts to educate the wider community on 
                                                the issues facing those who experienced homelessness.&nbsp; She worked diligently 
                                                to identify and address the gaps in service and helped to organize training sessions 
                                                for shelter providers.&nbsp; She was instrumental in reducing the eviction rate,

                                                was a widely known and respected expectation.&nbsp; Even after her retirement last

                                            <p>For many years, Ms. Heckstall has been fervently devoting her time and energy to improve the lives of her Dauphin County neighbors who are in need of assistance.&nbsp; She is considered a champion of hunger by many, as she spends much of her time at the Food Pantry at Antioch Tabernacle.</p>
                                            <p>While Ms. Heckstall has sometimes also personally faced the issue of food insecurity, she has done so with a faith and optimism that is unshakeable.&nbsp;It is this fortitude that has served her well as she has encouraged others to not feel ashamed of their hardship, but rather to persevere, in spite of the adversity they may be facing.&nbsp; Her understanding and compassion for others has touched many lives, both at the Food Pantry and beyond.&nbsp; As was so eloquently stated in her nomination, “In spite of her own adversities in life, Dot continues to strive to provide a spirit of caring and inspiration to others on a daily basis by serving those in need, and not only with food and nourishment,&nbsp;&nbsp;but with dignity and compassion.”</p>
                                            <p>Demonstrating her commitment to this mission, Ms. Heckstall did not waste any time recovering from surgery this past year before she was back at the Food Pantry assisting her hungry neighbors.&nbsp; It only took her one day of rest before she was back on her feet serving others.</p>

                                            <p>Aung Naing Oo was born in 1992 in the forest somewhere between Burma and Thailand as his parents fled the tyranny of the Burmese army.&nbsp; He does not remember his mom dying, but knows that she died of a heart attack as a result of the difficult journey to Thailand.&nbsp; His father abandoned him at the refugee camp in Thailand and left him in the care of his uncle.&nbsp;</p>
                                            <p>At the age of 16, and with the help of the United Nations, Aung and his uncle made the difficult journey to the United States.&nbsp; With the help of Lutheran Refugee Services, Aung and his uncle began to build a life in Lancaster and Aung enrolled at the International School at McCaskey East in April 2008.&nbsp; Finding it difficult to support both he and Aung, his uncle placed Aung in foster care in January 2009 and left Lancaster.&nbsp;</p>
                                            <p>Despite these overwhelming obstacles, Aung has shown remarkable resilience.&nbsp; He has become an outstanding student, joined the soccer team his junior year, and was chosen by his peers as a member of the Homecoming Court.&nbsp; Aung graduated from McCaskey in June with a 3.2 GPA, and he is currently enrolled at Harrisburg Community College planning to study Human Services so that he can someday work abroad helping people access education so that they can have the same opportunities that he did.</p>

                                            <p>The Essence of Humanity Award honors those who inspire the best in all of us, through the presentation of the award and also by elevating the narratives of the recipients. The program began in 2001 when business and community leaders in South-Central Pennsylvania established the award. The award is presented by participating organizations in collaboration with the Essence of Humanity program’s steering committee, which evaluates the nominations.
