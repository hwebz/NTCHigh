                                                Kristen Pfautz Woolley was presented with an Essence of Humanity award in 
                                                    recognition of her work making a significant difference in the lives of abused 
                                                    children and women who have been victims of child sexual abuse, despite facing 
                                                    the tremendous challenge of such abuse in her own life.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The three words that most describe Kristen are compassion (she has maintained a 
                                                tremendous level of empathy despite her experience of abuse at a young age),
                                                optimism (she has a great capacity to believe that things can change for the good) 
                                                and courage (child sexual abuse is one of the hardest issues to face in our society 
                                                today, and she does so with great courage and at some personal cost).
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Suffering significant trauma and loss, Kristen has embarked on a courageous process 
                                                of healing, and of using her own pain to make a difference for others.&nbsp; She 
                                                completed her MSW as well as a post-graduate certification in child sexual abuse 
                                                treatment.

                                                “I was determined to do something good with my awful,” says Kristin. She dedicates
                                                 her life’s work to helping others on a path to healing. In November of 2012, 
                                                 she opened her own non-profit, the <a class="link" target="_blank"

                                                 Center</a>, using seed money she inherited from her mother to start the 
                                                 center. Inspired by the compassion and<br />
                                                safety she finally received by a therapist as an adult woman who helped her with 
                                                her healing process, she wanted to create a safe place for women to share their 
                                                abuse, break their silence, and not have to carry the burden alone.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Throughout her path to healing, Kristen demonstrated the essence of humanity in the following 
                                                ways:
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <strong>Courage and Strength</strong>:&nbsp; As part of her healing process, Kristen
                                               decided to report her own abuse.&nbsp; At age 25, she contacted the State Police, 
                                               Children &amp; Youth and the DA’s office, only to learn that due to the statute of 
                                               limitations, nothing could be done.&nbsp; So she did the next thing she could think 
                                               of&mdash;she faced her perpetrator.&nbsp; This takes phenomenal courage for any 
                                               victim of abuse.&nbsp; Facing down, and calling out, ones’ own abuser, requires 
                                               tremendous courage.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kristen refused to remain silent, meeting with her 
                                               abuser’s spouse to alert her to the danger her children may be in.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <strong>Persistence: </strong>Learning that there is a statute of limitations to 
                                               reporting her own abuse and understanding the dynamics of child sexual abuse and why 
                                               delayed disclosure is common, Kristen has made a commitment to meet with every member
                                               of the PA House Judiciary committee to advocate for House Bill 238 to be passed, 
                                               lifting the statute of limitations fully for victims of child abuse. For many 
                                               victims, as in Kristen’s case, it can take years to reach a point where they are 
                                               able to tell about their abuse.&nbsp; In Kristen’s words: “I want my rights back, 
                                               I want my day in court, I deserve it and every victim does.”
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <strong>Determination</strong>:&nbsp;Kristen is determined to help herself and other women make the 
                                                journey from victim to survivor, and understand that they can move beyond their abuse and thrive in
                                                 their relationships and families.&nbsp; She has invested a tremendous amount of time and resources
                                                 in opening Turning Point to create a space where women can themselves begin to make the journey 
                                                from victim to survivor.

                                            <p>
                                                <strong>Encouragement and Inspiration</strong>:&nbsp; Kristen has used her own experience as the 
                                                catalyst that drives her to serve on the Board of the York County Children’s Advocacy Center, where
                                                 children have a safe place to disclose the abuse that has happened to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; She has
                                                 taken her own experience and transformed it into a safe place at Turning Point for women to begin
                                                 their own process of healing.
                                            </p>

                                                <strong>Love: </strong>Kristen is dedicated to helping others heal, and this capacity to show love
                                                 to others when they most need it is an indication of how far she has come in making the journey
                                                 from victim to survivor.&nbsp; Survivors are able to reach out and provide support to others who 
                                                are experiencing pain and be a support to them.
